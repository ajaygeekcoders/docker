To store a docker image

AWS uses ECR > Repositories

In ECR Repositories we can store the same image with different versions and tags

You can find the push command on aws ECR after you create a repository for your image

To push a docker image from local to aws you need to have aws credential pre configured in your local for push command
> AWS cli need to be installed
> Credentials configured
